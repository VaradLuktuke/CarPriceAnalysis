# CarPriceAnalysis
The goal of this project is to predict car prices using machine learning techniques and evaluate the quality of the data using statistical tests. To achieve the goal, we will be using a dataset that contains information on various car features such as fuel type, mileage, and horsepower. We will preprocess the data, select relevant features, and then train and evaluate multiple machine-learning models. We applied statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to identify the most important factors that influence car prices and developed a model that can predict the price of a car based on these factors. Our analysis showed that features such as fuel type, mileage, and horsepower are significant determinants of car prices. We will use statistical tests to determine the quality of the data and ensure the validity of our model.
